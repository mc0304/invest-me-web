- I want to implement bootstrap on the navbar only and not globally (view comments in navbar.component.html, lines 6 and 24)
- I need to figure out routing from Open an Account button in navbar component to open-account component template html (done?)

Changes I made to make the home component the first page to load instead of the shell component.
    - In the app-routing.module.ts I added { path: '', component: HomeComponent } to the routes variable
